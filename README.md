# ShiftLog

A small scheduling/time-tracking API. Workers get scheduled onto shifts;
ShiftLog rejects shifts that overlap for the same worker, lets you filter
shifts by worker or date range, and runs a lightweight background job that
logs shifts starting soon.

Built as the starter repo for the freeCodeCamp/NHCarrigan Summer 2026
Cohort sprint phase. It's a real, runnable app - fork/branch it, pick up an
issue, and open a PR.

## Stack

- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for the HTTP API
- [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/) (SQLAlchemy + Pydantic) for models and validation
- PostgreSQL for storage
- `docker-compose` to run everything with one command
- `pytest` + FastAPI's `TestClient` for tests

## Quickstart

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up --build
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. Interactive docs
(Swagger UI) are at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

Tables are created automatically on startup - there's no migration step to
run. To load some sample workers and shifts once the stack is up:

```bash
docker-compose exec api python seed.py
```

### Running locally without Docker

**Requires Python 3.12** (see `.python-version`). `psycopg2-binary==2.9.9`
only ships prebuilt wheels through Python 3.12 - on 3.13+ pip falls back to
building it from source, which fails unless you happen to have PostgreSQL's
dev headers installed. If `pip install -r requirements.txt` fails with a
"Getting requirements to build wheel" error, this is almost certainly why -
switch to 3.12 rather than trying to fix the build.

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Point DATABASE_URL at a Postgres instance you have running, e.g. one
# started with `docker-compose up db`.
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://shiftlog:shiftlog_dev_password@localhost:5432/shiftlog

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Running tests

Tests run against an in-memory SQLite database, so no Postgres instance or
`.env` file is needed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```

### Running tests with Docker

You can run the tests against an actual instance of Shiftlog, be sure it is a development instance, because tests may cause data changes or loss:

```bash
docker exec -it shiftlog-api-1 pytest
# or
docker compose exec api pytest
```

Note: `shiftlog-api-1` is the name of the container running the Shiftlog API, which you need to confirm.

## Rate Limiting

Some endpoints are rate-limited. Exceeding the limit returns **`429 Too Many Requests`**. Please refer to the table below:

| Method | Path           | Limit                      |
| ------ | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| POST   | `/workers`     | 10 requests per 30 seconds | 
| PUT    | `/workers{id}` | 10 requests per 30 seconds |
| DELETE | `/workers{id}` | 10 requests per 30 seconds |

A shift conflicts with another shift for the _same worker_ when their time
ranges overlap. Back-to-back shifts (one ending exactly when the next
starts) are not conflicts.

### How conflict detection works

ShiftLog checks for overlap with a standard half-open interval test:

    existing.start_time < new.end_time AND existing.end_time > new.start_time

If both conditions are true, the shifts overlap and the new shift is rejected with a 409.

**Example — conflict:**

- Existing shift: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM
- New shift: 3:00 PM – 11:00 PM

`9:00 < 11:00` ✅ and `5:00 > 3:00` ✅ → both true, so this **conflicts**.

**Example — back-to-back, not a conflict:**

- Existing shift: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM
- New shift: 5:00 PM – 11:00 PM

`5:00 > 5:00` is **false**, so the check fails and the shift is **allowed**. One shift ending exactly when the next begins does not overlap.

### ASSUMPTIONS:

- It is assumed that the port `8000` is available on the host machine.

### Background job

On startup, ShiftLog kicks off a simple `asyncio` loop (see
`app/background.py`) that periodically checks for shifts starting soon and
logs them. It's intentionally not a full task queue like Celery - just
enough to demonstrate scheduled background work.
